# Homework 2: Doubly linked list, iterators

You are given five files.

   LinkedList.java is an implementation of a singly linked list.
   
   DLinkedList.java is an implementation of a doubly linked list.
		
   LinkedListIterator.java is an implementation of an iterator for a singly linked list.

   DLinkedListIterator.java is supposed to be an implementation of an iterator for a doubly linked list. Currently, it is identical to LinkedListIterator.java (aside for the class names). 

   Sorts.java includes a main method testing selection sort and a stub for the sort itself.

## TODO

   Modify DLinkedListIterator.java to support a doubly linked list (edits are necessary wherever the file has a ```// TODO ``` comment)

   Modify Sorts.java to include an implementation of Selection Sort using the ListIterator interface (which both included iterator implementations fulfill)

As always, start by accepting the assignment in github classroom and activating travis.

Then clone it to your computer, create a hw branch, and start making changes.

Remember that you have not submitted until you have opened a pull request and @mentioned me.

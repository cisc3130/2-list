# Homework 2: Iterator exercise

Implement the following three methods in IteratorExercise.java using only list iterator methods:

   bubbleSort: sort the provided list using bubble sort
   reverseList: reverse the list
   removeEveryOtherElement: remove every odd-indexed element in the list.

Do not modify the test code in each function. You can look at that code for some ideas for implementing the methods.
